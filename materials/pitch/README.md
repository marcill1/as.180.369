## Mon Sep 25: Research Pitches

You will create a pitch, consisting of any visual aid of your choice. The pitch
should be no longer than 5 minutes in duration and should convey the following
items:

- Exhibit understanding of existing literature around your topics (30%)
    - You will share your screen showing LitMaps results.
- Clear research question (25%)
    - Do you understand the topic you selected?
    - Were you able to articulate it as a research question?
- Preview/outline of what you plan to do to answer that question. (25%)
- Fit & finish (20%)
    - Visual aides should be clear, concise, and not too wordy.
    - Speaking style should slow and understandable.
    - All ideas conveyed within the time limit.

    - Include a collection of papers you think you will cite.
    - Refine the assortment of papers from Litmaps into a *collection* in Paperpile.
    - Obtain PDF files of all papers.
    - Add Paperpile tags to each paper to track their thesis.
