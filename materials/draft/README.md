## Mon Oct 9 — Coping Strategies

[Zoom recording. Requires JHU login.](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mzahn2_jh_edu/EQdZHFe5L8pJu5vCz0mMYIYBtB5NVxPLGpiDp8IxA43Nsg?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0RpcmVjdCJ9fQ&e=uE33s1)

**Agenda**
- Share your *improved* visualization!
    - Students will use Zoom to share their screen & Jupyter Notebook.
    - Speak to the improvements made on the data visualization and justify
      why you made those changes.
    - We will work through any `git` difficulties you encountered.

- *CR* Coping with `git` and https://github.com (30 min.)
    - Getting your bearing at the command line
    - Getting your bearing with `git`
    - Debugging common issues with `git` and [github](https://github.com)
    - `git` cheatsheet

- *CR* Coping with Jupyter Notebooks (30 min.)
    - Missing packages and environments
        - What are `pip install` and `conda install`?
        - How to recognize when packages are missing?
        - How to find and document missing packages?

**Homework**
- Continue working on the Introduction and Abstract for final papers.
- Use ChatGPT to improve your writing. Please save your ChatGPT prompts in your commit messages.
- Spread out commit messages over at least three days.

**Helpful notes**
- Abstract:
    - Results you hope to get. Write as if you got the results you wanted that align with your hypothesis.
    - Note why people should care about your findings.
    - Tight: Less than 200 words.
- Introduction:
    - Longer than Abstract.
    - Position the paper in terms of our current understanding/debates on the subject.
    - Motivate why you are studying this topic and why it is important. Big pictire, what is the point of your paper. 
    - Aim for about a page or a page and a half (~500 to 750 words).
    - Focus on writing well. The content is less important than the process and demonstration of using the tools to improve the content you generate.
