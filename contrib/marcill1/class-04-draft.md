- Inequality is increasing, trends
- Partisan divide regarding economic inequality in United States
- Metric for inequality
- Thesis: Republican Congress creates more inequality? 

    Inequality in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s (Rodriguez). Inequality In the United States, policies regarding income equality had become a partisan issue. Republicans often have strong ties with businesses, which often promotes policies in favor of lower minimum wages. Democrats, contrarily, often work with labor-unions to help promote policies in favor of increasing minimum wages. Using the GINI coefficient, which measures the level of inequality within a given country, we can determine how strong of a role partisanship in Congress and the party affiliation of the President plays in the increasing wealth inequality of the United States, and if this relationship is present, help us understand why inequality still continues to rise even after Democratic-led Congresses. We will investigate if either Congress or the Executive Branch, depending on party affiliation, have more of an impact on the Gini index, while also examining whether significant changes of Gini are present during a government trifecta, which is when a single party controls both chambers of Congress and the Presidency.

    The Gini coefficient is a value that measures the level of income distribution and is often used as the standard metric for tracking economic inequality within a country. Gini coefficients range from 0-1; 0 being the lowest score possible, indicating no income inequality, and 1 being the highest possible level of income inequality. Since 1980, the Gini coefficient of the United States has steadily risen from 0.347 to being as high as 0.415 in 2019.
  During most of the 1980s, Democrats generally had more control over Congress. In general, Democratic members of Congress tend to vote in favour of policies supporting an increase in minimum wage (Bloch). It would then be reasonable to believe that during a Democratic government trifecta, where a single party controls The House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Presidency, more policies addressing inequality would be passed, since it would be less likely for laws to be vetod by either branch of the government. 
  Minimum wage in the United States has been raised only three times since 1990. However, policies addressing alternative minim tax (AMT) have allowed it to adjust to inflation, which benefits those with higher incomes. No federal policies have been passed that automatically adjust the federal minimum wage to inflation (Koger).
  Since 1980, there have been five instances of a government trifecta, three of which were led by Democrats and the other two by Republicans. During these periods of government trifecta, we will explore whether the Gini coefficient of the United States changed significantly and in which direction this change occured. We expect the Gini coefficient to increase during periods of a Republican trifecta. and the opposite to occur during a Democratic trifecta. We will then examine if any policies during these periods addressing inequality, such as policies aimed towards increasing minimum wage or modifying the AMT system, were passed or blocked to help explain for any trends we discover.
