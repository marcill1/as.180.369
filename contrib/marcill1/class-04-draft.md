- Thesis: Republican Congress creates more inequality? 

    Inequality in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s (Rodriguez). Inequality In the United States, policies regarding income equality had become a partisan issue. Republicans often have strong ties with businesses, which often promotes policies in favor of lower minimum wages. Democrats, contrarily, often work with labor-unions to help promote policies in favor of increasing minimum wages. Using the GINI coefficient, which measures the level of inequality within a given country, we can determine how strong of a role partisanship in Congress plays in the increasing wealth inequality of the United States, and if this relationship is present, help us understand why inequality still continues to rise even after Democratic-led Congresses.
