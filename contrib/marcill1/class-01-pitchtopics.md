# Two Topics

## CEO Pay to Worker Pay

I believe there may be at least a weak to moderate relationship. However, from what (I believe) to be true, the relationship may be overshadowed by the fact that the ratio has been steadily growing overtime since US minimum wage fails match inflation growth. This topic interests me because of the economic impacts of COVID-19; specifically, how to has been claimed that the pandemic has allowed the wealthy to get wealther. 

I believe that if a relationship is present, then the ratio of pay between CEOs and workers would increase during a Republican presidency and fall during Democratic presidencies. I believe this to be the case since Republican presidencies (Reagan, Trump) often pass policies that benefit the wealthy. 

## Unemployment Rate

I believe that it is less likely that unemployment rates have any relation  with the party affiliation of the president in power. I find it much more likely that an increase in unemployment rate would encourage voters to vote for a president of the party that is not in power. However, if there is a relationship, I find it much more likely for the unemployment rate to rise during Republican presidencies. Higher unemployment rates are more favorable for businesses since it allows for a larger labor supply, allowing them to keep wages low and have access a large pool of individuals seeking jobs.
