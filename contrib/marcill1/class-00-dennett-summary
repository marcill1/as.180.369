Summary of Dennett

Dennett presents a bleak and pessimistic view of recent developments of artificial intelligence, moreso specifically the threat of
AI that are designed to mimic human speech and behavior. He compares this AI to counterfeit money, calling them "counterfeit people," and uses
this comparison to argue his main point; that the creation of counterfeit people should be stopped immediately, and that creating 
counterfeit people should be criminalized. 

One example of how counterfeit people pose a threat to our society is that it can erode democracy. Since democracy relies on informed citizens,
Dennett argues that counterfeit people allow for misinformation to spread, thus affecting how these people think, resulting in a tainted democratic
process. Another example Dennett presents is how the rich and powerful can use these counterfeit people to influence us for their own personal gains 
or agendas. These counterfeit people, unlike traditional weapons, are able to reproduce and inform each other, thus allowing for the natural evolution of 
AI personalities that able to present themselves as more human-like or evade any safeguards we produce against them. 

Some methods already being used to help prevent their proliferation is to create systems that acts as a watermark to help identify a counterfeit person. 
Another method is to hold bad actors accountable by punishing those who help contribute to the creation of harmful AI. 

While Dennet acknowledges that AI will have plenty of economic benefit, the argues that dangers of AI must be first addressed prompptly before
the consequences are fully realized.
