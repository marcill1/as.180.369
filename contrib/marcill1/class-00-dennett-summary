Summary of Dennett

Dennett presents a bleak and pessimistic view of recent developments of artificial intelligence, moreso specifically the threat of
AI that are designed to mimic human speech and behavior.  AI development has reached the point where most indivudals have difficulty 
discerning between text produced by humans and those produced by AI. He compares this AI to counterfeit money, calling them "counterfeit people," 
and uses this comparison to argue his main point; that the creation of counterfeit people should be stopped immediately, and that creating 
counterfeit people should be criminalized. Overall, his main argument is that counterfeit people pose an immediate threat to our society, and if 
left unaddressed, this rampant AI technology could grow out of our control.

One example of how counterfeit people pose a threat to our society is that it can erode democracy. Since democracy relies on informed citizens,
Dennett argues that counterfeit people allow for misinformation to spread, thus affecting how these people think, resulting in a tainted democratic
process. Another example Dennett presents is how the rich and powerful, such as mega-corporations or influential politicians,
can use these counterfeit people to influence us for their own personal gains or agendas. These counterfeit people, 
unlike traditional weapons, are able to reproduce and inform each other, thus allowing for the natural evolution of 
AI personalities that able to present themselves as more human-like or evade any safeguards we produce against them. 

One methods already being used to help prevent their proliferation is to create systems that acts as a watermark to help identify a counterfeit person.
These systems would inform users whenever the information being presented to them is AI generated and help address concerns regarding potential 
misinformation and deception. However, this relies on the cooperation from device companies and developers to help implement the strategy in
order to be fully effective. Companies that refuse to cooperate, or any bad actors that help contribute to the proliferation of
counterfeit humans, should then be punished and held accountable for the damage they have caused. Companies, such as Google or Microsoft for example,
that are involved with the creation of human-like AI would have to take proactive measures to prevent the threats Dennett outlines. Dennett argues that if
they refuse, then penalties or criminal charges would be enforced. Yet while these solutions are presented,
implementation requires a lot more work and can be costly. However, Dennett stresses that if safeguards
like these are not implemented sooner, counterfeit humans will only continue to spread, with consequences far costlier in the 
long run. If this were the case, the prevention would be too late, and rather we would have to implement a strategy of treatment.

While Dennet acknowledges that AI will have plenty of economic benefit, he argues that dangers of AI must be first addressed promptly before
the consequences are fully realized.
